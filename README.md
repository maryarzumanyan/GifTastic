## Introduction
Web page enables users to load and view images of various animals.
GIF images can be animated on demand. Images can be added to favorites. New animal topics can be added as you go.

## Seach
On the top right you can see the "Add an animal" form. Type an animal name and search for it. New animal button will be added to the head of the page. Use these new buttons to load new set of images about this animal.

## Load Images
Each time you click on the animal button page loads new set of 10 images. Images are stacked, so newly loaded images will always be on the top, while older images will scroll down.
Click on the image will start or stop the animation.
There's a plus button on the top right side of each image. It will add the image to the favorites section.

## Favorites
You can find the favorites section on the right side of the screen. Refresh will preserve your favorites. You have an option to remove images from favorites by clicking the X button that's on the top right of the image.
